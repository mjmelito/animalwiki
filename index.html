            <ul>
              <li>Insects don’t have bones or a backbone like us. They’re called invertebrates. That means they have a hard exoskeleton, or shell, on the outside of their bodies that protects them.</li>
              <li>All insects have three parts: the head, the thorax, which is the middle part, and the abdomen, or end part.</li>
              <li>Insects have two antennae. They also have six legs.</li>
              <li>Spiders are not insects. Spiders have eight legs. They are related to scorpions and belong to the arachnid family.</li>
              <li>All insects hatch from eggs. The babies are called larva.</li>
